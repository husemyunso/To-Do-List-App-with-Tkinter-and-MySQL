- Delete individual tasks or clear the entire list
- Display the total number of tasks
- Choose a random task from the list
- Persistent task storage using MySQL
- User-friendly interface with Tkinter

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- MySQL server installed and running
- `mysql-connector-python` library installed

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
